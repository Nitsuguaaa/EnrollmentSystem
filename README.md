# A basic enrollment system using java

> If you're too lazy to make an enrollment system for your school project then here it is

- To give you context. This is a simple enrollment system using java.
 I used netbeans IDE to code this. The code is still unfinished and
 I will update this description once it is.
 
- The file names are quite tricky so I'll give you the overview:
  - mainint.java - Main code that runs that whole process
  - usermenu.java - Main user interface
  - secint.java - By running this code it will list all the students in the directory
  - thirint.java - This searches for a specific student name
  - forint.java - this lets you create a new student

- Upcoming features :
  - [ ] GUI
  - [ ] Admin panel and User panel
  - [ ] Login system

> I'm new to programming sorry.
